## Changelog

Public releases are all root nodes.  
Incremental version bumps that were not released publicly are nested where appropriate.

P.S. If there is a standard (popular) changelog format, please let me know.


- **0.2.0 : 2012.02.01**   
  Features
    - Add Theme Packages v 0.1.0
      All themes should be tracked and maintained outside of JB core.
      Themes get "installed" via the Theme Installer.
      Theme Packages versioning is done separately from JB core with
      the main intent being to make sure theme versions are compatible with the given installer.
